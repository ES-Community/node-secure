<p>
    We have detected different licenses in <strong>package.json</strong> and
    other licenses files (<strong>LICENSE</strong>,
    <strong>LICENSE.MD</strong> etc). This probably means that there is an
    inconsistency in the choice of the license (or a file not updated yet with
    the right license).
</p>
<p>
    This flag has not been created to detect multiple licenses / conformance
    rules. Example: <code>ISC OR GPL-2.0-with-GCC-exception</code>. Under the
    hood we use
    <a href="https://github.com/cutenode/conformance#readme">conformance</a> to
    parse licenses !
