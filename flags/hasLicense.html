    This flag mean that we have not detected any licenses in the npm Tarball (or
    something went wrong in the detection) For detecting licenses we are reading
    the <strong>package.json</strong> and searching for local files that contain
    the word "license".
</p>
<p>
    For more information on how license must be described in the package.json,
    please check the
    <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#license" rel="nofollow"
        >npm documentation</a
    >.
