    The project has been detected as a GIT repository. Sometimes a dependency on
    the package.json link to a GIT repository, example:

    "dependencies": {
        "uNodeHttpServer": "git+https://github.com/tpoisseau/uNodeHttpServer.git#1.2.0"
    }
}</code></pre>
<br/>

    <a href="https://github.com/npm/pacote#readme">pacote</a> to fetch and
    extract packages we are supporting this given pattern.
