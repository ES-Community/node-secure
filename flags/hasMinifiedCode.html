    Has one or many files that has been detected as minified JavaScript code. We
    use a package that will tell us if the code is minified (in case the file as
    a <strong>.min</strong> then we will consider the file minified by default).
</p>
<br />
<p>
    Minified JavaScript code are commonly used by hacker to obfuscate the code
    to avoid being spotted. A good practice is surely to check all the packages
    with the flag.
</p>
<br />
<p>Example of minified code:</p>
<br />
<pre><code>function cleanRange(version){const firstChar=version.charAt(0);if(firstChar==="^"||firstChar==="<"||firstChar===">"||firstChar==="="||firstChar==="~"){return version.slice(version.charAt(1)==="="?2:1)}
   return version}</code></pre>

        ⚠️ sometimes one line file are considered minified (we are working to
        fix this in the future).
