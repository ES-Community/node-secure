<p>
    This mean that AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis of one of the JavaScript
    code of the package has failed because the code was to complicated. For
    example if your package contains a .js file with the following content:
</p>
<br />
<pre><code>const { readFileSync } = require("fs");
const { join } = require("path");
const myLib = require("./lib");</code></pre>
<br />
<p>
    Then the AST analysis will return <code>fs</code>, <code>path</code> and
    <code>./lib</code> as required dependencies. The code will not be considered
    suspicious ! But if we take a malicious code:
</p>
<pre><code>function unhex(r) {
   return Buffer.from(r, "hex").toString();
}

const g = Function("return this")();
const p = g["pro" + "cess"];

const evil = p["mainMod" + "ule"][unhex("72657175697265")];
evil(unhex("68747470")).request</code></pre>
<p>
    This code require the core package http but the AST analysis is not capable
    to get it (not yet üòÅ). So the code will be flagged as "suspect".
